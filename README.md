### What I learned

Since it was my first website I built on om own, there were times where I stumbled upon some problems and searched on Google to get the answer.

For example wrapping content under class inside span tag to get the desired look shown in the preview for Nutrients section:

```html
<li><span class="nutrients">Calories</span><span class="values">277kcal</span></li>
```
